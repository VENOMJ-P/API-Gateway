Frontend - Middle-End - Backend


- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make  decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.

Conclusion
These three layers or aspects are essential to building an application, software or system. Commonly, most software developers specialize in only one aspect of the development layer but will have a fair knowledge of the other two layers and their workings. The type of developers that are proficient in all three areas or layers of development is called ‘full stack’ developers.

Though sometimes, the layer blurs and there may not be a clear-cut differentiation between layers, especially between the front end and the back end, the three layers are still the combination of any software or system.
